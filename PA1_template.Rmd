# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r load.and.preprocess}
act <- read.csv("activity.csv")
data <- act[complete.cases(act),]  # only data without missing values
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

First, we compute the total of steps taken in each day:
```{r steps.in.each.day}
steps.by.day <- aggregate(list(steps=data$steps),
                          by = list(date=data$date), sum)
```

Whose frequencies are characterised by the following histogram
```{r histogram, echo = FALSE}
hist(steps.by.day$steps, xlab="Steps", main="Total steps taken per day")
```

The values of the mean and the median are:
```{r basic.stats, echo = FALSE}
mean(steps.by.day$steps)
median(steps.by.day$steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
